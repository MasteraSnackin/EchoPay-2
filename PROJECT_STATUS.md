### 2. Backend API
- **Express.js server** with enhanced command parsing
- **Voice command recognition** for payment, balance, and transaction queries
- **Mock transaction processing** with realistic simulation
- **RESTful API endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/process-command` - Process voice commands
  - `GET /api/transactions` - Get transaction history
  - `GET /api/health` - Health check
- **Transaction storage** and history management

### 3. Frontend Application
- **React + TypeScript** application with modern UI
- **Polkadot wallet integration** (SubWallet, Talisman, etc.)
- **Voice recognition** using Web Speech API
- **Real-time balance display** from Westend testnet
- **Contact management** with mock data

cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
cd ..

# Start development environment
npm run dev
```

### Smart Contract Operations
```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy locally
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

# Deploy to testnet
