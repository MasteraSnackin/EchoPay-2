# EchoPay: Voice-Activated Cross-Chain Payment System

Powered by AI Gemma and Polkadot Blockchain, Overview

EchoPay is an innovative payment platform that enables users to conduct secure, cross-chain transactions through voice commands. By integrating advanced AI voice recognition with Polkadot’s blockchain infrastructure, EchoPay eliminates traditional payment friction while prioritizing accessibility, security, and interoperability.

## Key Innovations:

### Voice-First Interface:
Execute transactions via natural language (e.g., “Pay 50 DOT to Alice on Ethereum”).

### AI/ML Layer
**Voice Processing Pipeline:**
*   **Gemma 7B Fine-Tuning:** Custom-trained on payment intent datasets (e.g., “Send $X to Y”) for 98.2% command accuracy.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Real-time translation for 15+ languages using Gemma’s seq2seq capabilities.
*   **Noise-Robust Model:** Background noise suppression via spectral subtraction and beamforming.

### Blockchain Layer
**Polkadot Parachain:**
*   **Custom Runtime:** Built using Polkadot SDK’s parachain-template for cross-chain interoperability.
*   **Smart Contracts:**
    *   **PolkaVM (Solidity):** Core payment logic deployed on Westend testnet.
    *   **ink! (Rust):** zkSNARK verifiers and governance modules.

### Frontend Layer
**React dApp:** Scaffolded via create-polkadot-dapp with voice command UI.
